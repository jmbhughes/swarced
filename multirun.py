'''You can execute many ketu runs from the commandline using this program.
Runs should be formatted like:
python multirun.py path_to_query_directory
The query directory should contain all the query pickled dictionaries you wish
to run. There can only be one per EPIC_ID. The output files will be paced in the
same location. 
Using this naming convention, you can only have one query for a particular
epicID in each location or else it will be overwritten!
